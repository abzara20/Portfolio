              I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but have lived in Indianapolis a
              majority of my life. I graduated from IUPUI in 2022 with a
              Bachelors in Informatics and another in Media Arts and Design,
              with a focus on Full Stack Web Development. For a long time, my
              focus has been in Graphic Design, where I have certifications in
              Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. With this I pursued a
              minor in Studio Arts and Technology, so I have a strong background
              in artistry and design.
              <br />
              <br />
              Some of my activites involve teaching students about STEM and
              design, such as being a mentor in the iDEW summer workshops
              program. I had also mentored a high school robotics team for a
              time called the Pike Robodevils in Marketing and Promotions,
              teaching students how to use the Adobe Creative Suite.
              <br />
              <br />
              My experiences have led me to build strong teamwork and
              communication skills, in addition to problem solving skills and an
              eye for detail. I am mostly interested in pushing further and
              gaining more experience in field of Web design and development.
