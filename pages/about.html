                        I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but have lived in Indianapolis a majority of my life.
                         Currently I have a double major in Informatics and Media Arts and Science, with a specialization 
                        in Web Design and Development. For a long time, my focus has been in Graphic Design, where I have certifications in Adobe
                        Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. With this I pursued a minor in Studio Arts and Technology, so I have a strong background in
                        artistry and design. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of my activites involve teaching students about STEM and design, where i had an internship where I taught elementary students
                        how to create robots out of legos in a program called "Summer Stretch", and mentored a high school robotics team called the Pike Robodevils
                        in Marketing and Promotions, teaching students how to use the Adobe Creative Suite.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My experiences have led me to build strong teamwork and communication skills, in addition to problem solving skills and an eye for detail. 
                        I am mostly interested in pushing further and gaining more experience in field of Web design and development.
