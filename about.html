                <p>My name is Abril Zaragoza-Palos, currently I am a junior studying full-stack web development in the IUPUI school of 
                    Informatics and Computing. At the same time, I am pursuing a minor in Studio Arts and Technology. I've gotten a lot of experience
                     with Graphic Design, and at the same time have a lot of passion, and fun, with coding.
                    <br>
                    My experiences have led me to build strong teamwork and communication skills, in addition to problem solving skills and an eye for detail. I am mostly interested 
                    in pushing further and gaining more experience in field of Web design and development.
